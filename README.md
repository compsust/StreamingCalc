# Streaming Media Calculator

Copyright (C) 2021-2022 Stephen Makonin.

A Holistic End-To-End Model to Calculate the Carbon Footprint of Streaming Media.


**StreamingMediaCalc.numbers:** This is the macOS Numbers spreadsheet where the calculator and paper figures are located. We do not have a Python version of the calculator right now... any volunteers?

**LIMITS_2022.pdf:** This is the accompanying workshop paper that discusses the calculator. You must cite this paper if you use this calculator. 

**CITE_THIS.bib:** The BibTeX file is used for citation purposes in LaTeX projects.

**EPA *files*:** These files are the results of using the EPA Greenhouse Gases Equivalencies Calculator. 

## You Must Cite

 You **must cite** the LIMIT 2022 paper found in this repo if you use this calculator. I have included a *.bib* file for LaTeX authors. Here is an APA and IEEE example of how to cite this work:
